#  GifTastic - API + JSON   06-Week  Homework

## Requirements 

This app displays buttons related to a certain topic that when clicked, accesses the GIPHY API and generates 10 static GIPHY images. 

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.

If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

The gif is displayed with its title and rating (PG, G, etc.).

An added form to the page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the `topics` array. 

A new button is generated for the new value in the array.

When clicked the button generates the gif images for the new value.

A remove tv shows button was added to clear user inputs.
